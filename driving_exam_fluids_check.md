## Types of Fluids
The document talks about 4 types of fluids:

1. **Cooling Water (Kühlwasser)**: This is used to cool down the engine.
2. **Engine Oil (Motoröl)**: This lubricates the engine.
3. **Brake Fluid (Bremsflüssigkeit)**: This is used in the braking system.
4. **Wiper Water (Scheibenwaschwasser)**: This is used to clean the windshield.

## Checking Fluid Levels:

- **Cooling Water**: The level can be checked by looking through a small window on the coolant reservoir. It should be between the "min" and "max" marks.
- **Engine Oil**: You can check the level with a dipstick. The dipstick should be clean before you check the level. The level should be between the "min" and "max" marks.
- **Brake Fluid**: The level is checked by looking through a small window on the brake fluid reservoir. It should be between the "min" and "max" marks.
- **Wiper Water**: The level is checked by looking through a small window on the wiper water reservoir. It should be between the "min" and "max" marks.

## Refilling Fluids:

- **Cooling Water**: If the level is low, you can refill the coolant reservoir. Be careful not to overfill it.
- **Engine Oil**: If the level is low, you can refill the engine with oil. Be careful not to overfill it.
- **Brake Fluid**: If the level is low, you can refill the brake fluid reservoir. Be careful not to overfill it.
- **Wiper Water**: If the level is low, you can refill the wiper water reservoir. Be careful not to overfill it.
